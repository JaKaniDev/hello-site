## April 17, 2025 - Major ovrall learning progress

- Setup W3C account
- Started working through the W3C Html and CSS knowledge work
- Started a second website using W3C knowledge
- made minor changes to this file and the README file as well. Commited and 
pushed successfully.
- I added light text and list formatting, including css for the lists. Pushed 
the commit successful

- I am getting more and more interested in learnig more each day. I have been 
into resources and trying what I learn as I go. I haven't really built much as 
far as content for the sites I have started, but that will soon change.
- I am developing a sence of there I want all this to go. 
    * Build a couole of websites and develop my sense of development. An 
html/css site, and a full stack site a little later.
    * Build an app, or 2. Get a basic sence of what serious development is 
about.
    * Get to know AI. Deeply. Fins use cases that can help me achieve more, 
even add to my career path.

One thing I need to do is get really organized and begin to utilize some 
critical thinking on tracking what I am doing.
